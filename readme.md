# Gas-Rush

Gas-Rush provides necessary gas prices to get insights on current gas prices which are required to run the Ethereum Blockchain.

## Motivation

Crypto exchanges constantly interact with Ethereum blockchain to carry out various activities like withdraws, dApp Interactions, etc. Everytime exchanges make an interaction a transaction fee is charged: Gas used by the transaction \* Gas Price. Gas-Rush provides crucial APIs to get Gas Prices and utilize the chain in a cost effective manner. Gas-Rush uses publicly available gas price data-feeds from Etherscan which gives gas prices in Gwei.

## Configuration

To run the application we need to set environment variables, edit example.env to .env

- Etherscan API Key to get gas prices from data-feed

  1. `Create an account to get the API key` - [Etherscan](https://docs.etherscan.io/getting-started/creating-an-account)

- Set variables

1. `PORT` - Specifies which port server should run on
2. `MONGODB_URL` - Set the connection string of MongoDB
3. `MONGODB_DB`- Set your DB name here
4. `POLLTIME`- Polling time in ms
5. `APIKEY` - Enter your API key here
6. `APIURL` - Etherscan API URL here

you can find starter variables given except for the Etherscan API KEY in example.env
